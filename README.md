Mispricing of S&amp;P500 Index Options: Methodological Artifact or Robust Market Inefficiency.

This study investigates the pricing efficiency of the market for one-month S&P 500 index options
using two sets of stochastic arbitrage conditions and a distributionally robust optimization.
Additionally, factor regression analysis is employed to test for CBOE option strategies exposures.
Non-parametric arbitrage conditions are applied to avoid relying on parametric pricing formulas.
Two sets of constraint systems are compared: the sufficient but not necessary stochastic arbitrage
conditions of Constantinides et al. (2020) and alternative general necessary conditions of Post and
Kovalenko (2025). Out-of-sample tests demonstrate that alternative conditions identify stochastic
arbitrage opportunities more completely and faster. Robust optimization is used to vary the market
risk premium, market volatility, and conditional skewness of returns within plausible bounds. The
out-of-sample results point to robust arbitrage opportunities in high-volatility regimes for a plausible
range of distribution estimators. Factor analysis distinguishes between risk-adjusted outperformance
and risk premiums arising from hidden risk exposures. Factor analysis suggests that predefined option
strategies do not explain the outperformance of the option-enhanced portfolio; instead, the gains
are driven by month-by-month optimization of option combinations, notably call front spreads with
appropriately chosen strike prices. The optimization model, therefore, identifies mispriced options
rather than relying on a fixed strategy.
